## Boston City Data Exercise
The goal of this exercise is to pick out the top 5 earners in Boston (total salary + overtime) and list them out in the web page as shown below:
Name     Total Earned 

You are given file index1.html which you will need to edit. You can rename it to index.html for convenience. However, if you want to use GitHub Pages to display your README.md then Pages will use your index.html file instead.

You also need to use curl to get the Boston City data from https://pollysnips.s3.amazonaws.com/bostonEmployeeSalaries.json

NOTE:

This is a little exercise that I had to do for my MITxPRO course.
