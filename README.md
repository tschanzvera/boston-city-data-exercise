## Boston City Data Exercise
The goal of this exercise is to pick out the top 5 earners in Boston (total salary + overtime) and list them out in the web page as shown below:
Name     Total Earned 


You also need to use curl to get the Boston City data from https://pollysnips.s3.amazonaws.com/bostonEmployeeSalaries.json

This is a little exercise that I had to do for my MITxPRO course.
